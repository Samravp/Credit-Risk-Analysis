# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Name: Can I Borrow App

## Slogan: "Your Reliable Loan Application Outcome Predictor"

This application was created using a machine learning model to predict if a credit card/loan application will get approved or not using supervised learning with scikit-learn and data manipulation with pandas.

Can I Borrow aims to provide a reliable and free tool for individuals to predict their credit risk and if their loan application will approved.

Please see the application deployed on Heroku [here](https://caniborrow22.herokuapp.com/).

## Datasets

We obtained our data from Kaggle, we used [Credit Card Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction). 

Another dataset that we used was Australia Bureau of Statistics's [Household Income and Wealth Dataset](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/finance/household-income-and-wealth-australia/latest-release)

This dataset provides below information:
- Household debt across Australia
- Household debt by age
- Trend of household debt from 2003 – 2018
- How does Australia’s household debt compare to other countries

## ETL Process

* **Extract**:Datasets were exported from abovementioned sources.

* **Transform**: Using Jupyter Notebook and pandas, we cleaned and reorganised the data according to our needs.

* **Load**: Considering the normalised and relational structure of our data, PostgreSQL would have been our database of choice, however, due to time constraints we skipped databasing step.

## Machine Learning


## Data Visualisation

We draw insights from our data using Tableau and Python's Matplotlib library in Jupyter Notebook.
